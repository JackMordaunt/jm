/*
Package flow holds concurrency shapes for work that splits into independent items.

Every shape obeys one rule: a worker owns its state and never shares it. Locks are
then unnecessary, and the caller merges the states once the run is over.

	width   how many workers a piece of work deserves
	each    claim items from a shared counter until they run out
	manage  the same, for work that discovers more of itself as it goes

/*
Run `work` over every item, across workers that claim one item at a time.

Each worker owns one slot of `states`, so `work` needs no locks. Merge the slots
afterwards, tolerating untouched ones. Anything else a worker touches must be read
only, or written at disjoint addresses.

Returning false stops the run; claimed items still finish.

`len(states)` sets the width, capped by `width(len(items), load)`; pass the `load`
the slice was sized with. One slot runs inline. Workers get a fresh context, so any
allocator the work needs belongs in `State`.

An item should cost more than the thirty microseconds it takes to start a thread.

/*
How many workers `items` pieces of work deserve. Size a state slice with it.

Computing work wants one worker per core; work parked in a device call wants several
times that, since it holds no core while it waits. `load` picks between them.

The answer starts from the core count, so no input size can run it away; `items` and
`limit` only reduce it. `limit` is also the cap when each worker needs a large buffer.

The multipliers are starting points, not measured.
